# Introduction to Aura Finance

## Business Summary

Aura Finance is a vault operator on Ethereum. Conceptually, Aura is similar to Convex Finance. If you are familiar with Convex, below is a direct comparison of Aura Finance and Convex Finance.

|  Convex / Curve  | Aura / Balancer  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| CRV |  Balancer 80/20 BAL/WETH BPT (referred as "BPT" below)   |
| veCRV | veBAL (Locked BPT up to a year) |
| cvxCRV  | auraBAL (BPT deposited with Aura)  |
| CVX   | Aura  |
| 3crv  | bb-a-usd  |

<br>

Like Convex farming CRV from Curve, Aura farms BAL from Balancer. Aura allows users to pool:

- Balancer's governance token, the BPT token of Balancer's BAL80-ETH20 pool; and
- LP tokens of Balancer pools.

Aura Finance locks the BPT tokens for veBAL, so that Aura could have boosted BAL rewards for Balancer pools and also influence the allocation of BAL to these pools. Aura then splits the rewards between BPT token providers and Balancer pool LP tokens providers. 

For more details on how Balancer's veBAL works, please refer to 
- https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/vebal-and-gauges. 

### Revenue Split
Aura charges a fee of 17% on all BAL revenue generated by Balancer LPs on Aura. And the fee (protocol-side revenue) is split amongst:
- 5.5% goes to auraBAL stakers. This is paid out as BAL.
- 11% goes to AURA lockers. This is paid out as auraBAL.
- 0.5% goes to the harvest caller. This is paid out as BAL.

## Financial Metrics

### Pool
Each pool of Aura Finance is a type of Balancer pool LP tokens deposited/staked with Aura Finance.

### TVL
Each pool's TVL is the value of Balancer pool LP tokens deposited in that Aura Finance pool. If there's no direct source of price of these LP tokens, the value of these LP tokens is the sum of the value of the underlying tokens. Balancer pools may have two to eight tokens in each Balancer pool.

> Pool TVL = $\sum$ token price X number of tokens in that pool

The protocol TVL is the sum of the TVL of the pools. 

It's optional to add:
- The TVL of auraBAL, which is the value of Balancer 80/20 BAL/WETH BPT minted with Aura Finance
- The TVL of AURA locked

However, we do note the current version of Convex Finance subgraph did not include the TVLs of the above.

### Revenue

#### Total Revenue
For each pool, its total revenue is the BAL rewards from Balancer, as harvested by Aura Finance for the corresponding Balancer pool tokens held and after applying the boost from the veBAL held.

> Pool Revenue = $\sum$ BAL price X number of BAL harvested

A Balancer pool will also generate the below yield as well but not counted as revenue:
- Trading fee. This accrues in the pool LP token and is not a revenue for Aura Finance;
- Additional rewards, as incentivised by other protocols from time to time. Aura Finance specifically states that "Fees are taken only from BAL revenue; no fees are taken from tokens from incentivized Balancer pools, nor from veBAL admin fees". So Aura Finance will receive this but pass it through 100% to its Balancer pool LP stakers. 

Aura Finance has also BPT providers and AURA stakers and they have no revenue impact:
- For the BPT providers (stakers or holders of auraBAL), the veBAL admin fees received by Aura Finance will be 100% passed through to them;
- No additional revenue generated by AURA holders or lockers.

The protocol revenue is the sum of the revenue of the pools. 

#### Supply-side and Protocol-side Revenue

As Aura Finance charges a 17% fee, 17% of the Total Revenue goes to the Protocol-side, and 83% goes to the Supply-side.

> Protocol-side Revenue = 17% x Total Revenue

> Supply-side Revenue = 83% x Total Revenue

### Rewards

Aura Finance incentivises its Balancer pool LP stakers by giving AURA tokens. 50% of AURA supply will be distributed pro-rata for BAL earned on Aura Finance. The total emission and details is available here:
- https://docs.aura.finance/aura/usdaura/distribution

For each pool, its reward is the Aura tokens received.

> Rewards = AURA price x Aura tokens received.

### Protocol owned liquidity
There's no protocol owned liquidity but there's a treasury.
